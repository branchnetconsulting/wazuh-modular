This is a placeholder for the upcoming Wazuh Modular project which addresses ways to richly modularize the configuration elements of Wazuh agents and Wazuh manaagers, 
and to securely distribute sensitive configuration content (like remote commands) to agents via code-signed WPK files and orchestration surrounding them.
We are still developing this solution and will share more as it is mature enough for a wider audience.
